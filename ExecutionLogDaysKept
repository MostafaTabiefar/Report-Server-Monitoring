# Changing the `ExecutionLogDaysKept` Setting in Report Server

By default, a **Report Server** instance retains execution logs for only the most recent **60 days**, equating to about **two months** of data. If you wish to extend or modify this retention period, consider the following options:

- **Setting the value to `0`**: This disables data retention entirely (no logs are kept).
- **Setting the value to `-1`**: This will retain logs **indefinitely**.

For this dashboard, it is recommended to retain execution log data for at least **one year (366 days)**. However, be aware that retaining logs for extended periods without proper management or archiving could lead to potential issues:

## Potential Issues with Extended Retention

### 1. **Disk Space Usage**
- **Problem**: Logs can grow significantly over time, especially with high report volumes or verbose logging.
- **Impact**: Excessive log growth can **consume disk space**, potentially degrading the performance of the report server and other applications sharing the same storage.

### 2. **Difficulty in Maintenance**
- **Problem**: As the number of logs increases, managing them becomes more difficult.
- **Impact**: Finding specific issues or patterns in the logs can become **time-consuming** and challenging.

### 3. **Security Risks**
- **Problem**: Keeping logs indefinitely increases the risk of **sensitive data exposure** if a breach occurs.
- **Impact**: Logs might contain sensitive information such as user details, reports, or configurations that could be exploited by attackers.

## How to Change the `ExecutionLogDaysKept` Setting

To modify the retention period, execute the following SQL query after connecting to your Report Server instance:

```sql
UPDATE dbo.ConfigurationInfo
SET Value = '366'  -- Or any desired retention period
WHERE Name = 'ExecutionLogDaysKept';
