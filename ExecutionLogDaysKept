Changing Report Server ExecutionLogDaysKept

by default Report Server instance will only keep the most recent 60 days in the execution log, which keeps about two months of data.
Keep in mind that:
1. Setting the value to 0 does not keep any data.
2. Setting the value to -1 keeps the data forever.

For this dashboard, I recommend retaining data for at least one year (365 + 1 days). However, please be aware that this could potentially lead to some issues.
If you keep all your report server logs without archiving or managing them, a few potential issues can arise:

1. Disk Space Usage
Problem: Logs can grow significantly over time, especially if you have a high volume of reports being processed or if the logging level is verbose.
Impact: This can lead to reduced disk space, potentially affecting the performance of the report server and other applications on the same server.
2. Difficulty in Maintenance
Problem: Managing an ever-growing number of log files can make routine maintenance tasks more challenging.
Impact: Searching for specific issues or patterns in logs might become time-consuming.
3. Security Risks
Problem: Retaining logs indefinitely increases the risk of sensitive data being exposed or exploited in case of a breach.
Impact: Logs may contain information about users, reports, or configurations that attackers could leverage.

How to Change ExecutionLogDaysKept:
Execute the following query after conecting to your report server instance:

UPDATE dbo.ConfigurationInfo
    SET Value = '366' -- Or Any Desired Periods
WHERE 1=1
    AND Name = 'ExecutionLogDaysKept'
