# Dashboard Goals
A comprehensive dashboard for monitoring report server performance, usage, and health.
The primary objective of this dashboard is to track end-users and analyze their behavior when accessing or interacting with our dashboards.


## Overview
This project provides a dynamic Report Server Monitoring Dashboard that enables users to track and analyze key metrics related to a report server. 
The dashboard is designed to give actionable insights into:
-User activity: Active users, report executions, and successful visits.
-Error monitoring: refresh(subscription) errors.
The goal is to help system administrators, BI developers, and analysts optimize their report server performance and troubleshoot refresh issues efficiently.
